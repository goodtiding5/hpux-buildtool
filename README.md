# HPUX buildtool

The latest GCC compiler from [HP-UX porting and archive center](http://hpux.connect.org.uk/) is 4.2.3, which is a bit out dated.

You can find version 4.6 and 4.7 from either [H.Merijn's repo](http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/downloads.html) or [vim's repo](http://ftp.vim.org/ftp/os/HPUX/itrc/).

For convenience, a copy is saved here.
